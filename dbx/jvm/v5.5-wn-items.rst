- Introduces performance improvements that are reflected in the driver performance
  benchmarks. To view the results of the performance benchmark tests, see the following
  :ref:`java-5.5-performance-improvements` section.

Performance Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   The tables in this section reflect the performance
   results of the synchronous Java driver. Since the improvements
   were made in the shared driver core, we expect similar performance
   improvement percentages for all Java drivers.

   The tests were conducted on MongoDB Server 8.0 with
   the following configuration:

   - Running on ``localhost`` with negligible network latency.
     In higher-latency environments, you might see less significant
     performance improvements.
   - Authentication disabled
   - TLS enabled
   
The following table shows the results of performance improvement 
tests for v5.5 of the driver configured with standard transport settings:
