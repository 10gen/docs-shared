- Adds experimental support for Queryable Encryption prefix, suffix, and substring queries.
  These features are unstable, and their security is not guaranteed until they're
  generally available (GA). Use them in experimental workloads only.
  To learn more about QE, see :ref:`In-Use Encryption <csharp-fle>`.

- Adds an ``nsType`` field to ``ChangeStreamDocument`` objects. This field contains the
  namespace type (``COLLECTION``, ``TIMESERIES``, or ``VIEW``) of the change event.

- Adds client-side operation timeout (CSOT) support for OIDC authentication.

- When ``timeoutMS`` is set for CSOT, the driver ignores the value of the ``maxWaitTime``
  connection setting.

- Adds an ``appendMetadata()`` method to the ``MongoClient`` class. You can use this method
  to append metadata to an existing client's metadata. The maximum
  metadata size is 512 MB.

- Adds a public constructor to the ``RewrapManyDataKeyOptions`` class.

- Merges the ``AsyncReadOperation`` and ``AsyncWriteOperation`` interfaces into the
  ``ReadOperation`` and ``WriteOperation`` interfaces. You can create read and write
  operations by using builder methods in the ``Operations`` class.

- Deprecates the ``MongoNamespace.COMMAND_COLLECTION_NAME`` constant.

- Fixes a bug that prevented OIDC reauthentication when working within a session.

- When serializing a POJO annotated with ``@BsonDiscriminator``, if the property's ``readName``
  matches the discriminator key, the driver serializes the field only once.

- After you call the ``next()`` or ``tryNext()`` method on a ``CommandCursorResult``
  instance, the driver clears the ``CommandCursorResult.results`` property to free memory.

- The ``PojoBuilderHelper`` class creates property models that include properties from
  abstract classes and interfaces.

- The driver publishes and logs the following events when the cluster topology changes:

  - ``ClusterOpeningEvent``: Published when the topology opens
  - ``ClusterDescriptionChangedEvent``: Published when the topology description changes
  - ``ClusterClosedEvent``: Published when the topology closes

- The driver throws a ``MongoStalePrimaryException`` when the primary replica set member
  becomes stale for one of the following reasons:

  - A new primary member is elected or discovered.
  - The value of the ``electionId`` or ``setVersion`` field in the primary member doesn't
    match the values of these fields in the other replica set members.

  To learn more about replica sets, see :manual:`Replication </replication/>` in the
  {+mdb-server+} manual.
