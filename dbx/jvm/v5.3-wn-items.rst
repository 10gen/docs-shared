- Adds the ``BinaryVector`` class to implement BSON Binary Subtype 9 for
  vector storage and retrieval. This class provides more effective storage
  of values compared a list of ``Double`` instances. You can create the
  following vector types based on the type of elements your vector contains:

  - ``Int8BinaryVector``: Vector of 8-bit signed integers

  - ``Float32BinaryVector``: Vector of floating-point numbers
  
  - ``PackedBitBinaryVector``: Binary quantized vector *(In beta and subject to change before becoming generally available)*

  To learn more about this feature, see :atlas:`Vector Quantization </atlas-vector-search/vector-quantization/>`
  in the Atlas documentation. |vector-type-example-link|

- Adds a sort option to the ``updateOne()`` and ``replaceOne()``methods. This change also allows
  you to set a sort as an option when creating ``ReplaceOneModel`` and ``UpdateOneModel`` instances.
  To learn more, see |update-replace-example-link|.
