- Adds the ``BinaryVector`` class to implement BSON Binary Subtype 9 for
  vector storage and retrieval. This class provides more effective storage
  of values compared a list of ``Double`` instances. You can create the
  following vector types based on the type of elements your vector contains:

  - ``Int8BinaryVector``: Vector of 8-bit signed integers

  - ``Float32BinaryVector``: Vector of floating-point numbers
  
  - ``PackedBitBinaryVector``: Binary quantized vector *(In beta and subject to change before becoming generally available)*

  To learn more about this feature, see :atlas:`Vector Quantization </atlas-vector-search/vector-quantization/>`
  in the Atlas documentation. |vector-type-example-link|

- Adds a sort option to the ``updateOne()`` and ``replaceOne()``
  methods. To learn more, see |update-replace-example-link|.

- Removes explicit fairness from the connection pool implementation.
  This change might contribute to better throughput when you use
  a ``MongoClient`` instance in many application threads. However, this
  change might cause increased tail latency.
