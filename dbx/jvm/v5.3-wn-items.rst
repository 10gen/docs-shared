- Adds the ``BinaryVector`` class to implement BSON Binary Subtype 9 for
  vector storage and retrieval. You can create the following vector
  types based on the type of elements your vector contains:

  - ``Int8BinaryVector``: Vector of 8-bit signed integers

  - ``Float32BinaryVector``: Vector of floating-point numbers
  
  - ``PackedBitBinaryVector``: Binary quantized vector
