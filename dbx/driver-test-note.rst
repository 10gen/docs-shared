   The check marks (âœ“) indicate the driver supports all features for the listed MongoDB version.

   Any driver version that is marked as compatible with MongoDB version 4.0 and later are
   tested to ensure they continue to work with newer versions of MongoDB. However, the
   older driver versions may not be able to access new server features.
