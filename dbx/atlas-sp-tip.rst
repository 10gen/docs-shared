.. tip:: Atlas Stream Processing

   As an alternative to change streams, you can use Atlas Stream
   Processing to process and transform streams of data. Unlike change streams,
   which register only database events, Atlas Stream Processing
   manages multiple data event types and provides extended data processing
   capabilities. To learn more about Atlas Stream Processing,
   see :atlas:`Atlas Stream Processing </atlas-stream-processing>` in the
   MongoDB Atlas documentation.
